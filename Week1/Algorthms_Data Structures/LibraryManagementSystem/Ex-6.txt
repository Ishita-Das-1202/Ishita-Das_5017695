Exercise 6: Library Management System

1.	Understand Search Algorithms:
	Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
	
	Linear Search:
	
	Linear search iterates through the list, comparing each element with the target value until it finds a match or reaches the end of the list.

	Binary Search:
	
	 Binary search works on sorted arrays/lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target value with the middle element and adjusting the search interval accordingly.


4.	Analysis:
	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.

	Linear Search:

	Best Case: O(1) (when the target is the first element).
	Average Case: O(n).
	Worst Case: O(n).
	Binary Search:

	Best Case: O(1) (when the middle element is the target).
	Average Case: O(log n).
	Worst Case: O(log n).


	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

	Linear Search:
	
	When the dataset is small

	When the dataset is unsorted
	
	When there are frequent insertions and deletions

	
	Binary Search
	
	When the dataset is large
	
	When the dataset is sorted
	
	When there are fewer insertions and deletions
